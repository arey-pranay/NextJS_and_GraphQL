1. **GraphQL vs REST APIs**
   - **Introduction to APIs**
     - What are APIs? 
     - Differences between REST and GraphQL
   - **Key Differences**
     - Data Fetching (Request/Response Patterns)
     - Data Structure (Over-fetching and Under-fetching)
     - Flexibility in Queries
   - **Performance Considerations**
     - Latency & Round Trips
     - Scalability
     - Handling Nested Resources
   - **When to Use REST API**
     - Simple or CRUD-based operations
     - Legacy systems integration
   - **When to Use GraphQL**
     - Complex data requirements
     - Real-time applications
   - **Example Use Cases**
     - REST API: E-commerce (product listings, user authentication)
     - GraphQL: Social media (user profile, interactions, media feeds)

2. **GraphQL and Next.js SSR (Server-Side Rendering) vs CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**
   - **What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?**
     - Benefits of SSR for SEO and performance
   - **What is Client-Side Rendering (CSR)?**
     - Benefits and challenges with CSR
   - **Using GraphQL with SSR in Next.js**
     - How GraphQL integrates with SSR
     - Example: Fetching data server-side using Apollo Client
     - Handling Authentication & Permissions in SSR
   - **Using GraphQL with CSR in Next.js**
     - Fetching data client-side using Apollo Client
     - Benefits of CSR in dynamic data applications
     - Example: Real-time updates with WebSockets or subscriptions
   - **Hybrid Approach in Next.js**
     - Mixing SSR & CSR in the same application
     - Example: Static pages with SSR and dynamic components with CSR

3. **Different Use Cases and Examples of GraphQL Queries**
   - **Simple Queries**
     - Fetching a list of items (e.g., products, posts)
     - Example query: `query { products { id name price } }`
   - **Complex Queries with Nested Resources**
     - Fetching related data in one request (e.g., user posts and comments)
     - Example query: `query { user(id: 1) { name posts { title comments { content } } } }`
   - **Mutations in GraphQL**
     - Creating, updating, and deleting data with mutations
     - Example mutation: `mutation { createPost(title: "New Post", content: "Content here") { id title content } }`
   - **Real-Time Data with Subscriptions**
     - Using subscriptions to get real-time updates (e.g., chat messages, live scores)
     - Example subscription: `subscription { messageAdded { content author } }`
   - **Query Variables and Dynamic Filters**
     - Using variables to dynamically change query parameters (e.g., filter products by category)
     - Example query with variables: 
       ```
       query getProducts($category: String) {
         products(category: $category) { name price }
       }
       ```
   - **Error Handling and Optimistic UI**
     - Handling errors in GraphQL queries and mutations
     - Example: Managing loading, error, and success states in UI

4. **GraphQL Schema Design and Best Practices**
   - **Types and Resolvers in GraphQL**
     - Understanding types (queries, mutations, subscriptions)
     - Writing resolvers to fetch data
   - **Efficient Schema Design**
     - Avoiding N+1 query problems
     - Schema stitching and federation
   - **Versioning in GraphQL**
     - Schema evolution and maintaining backward compatibility
   - **Security Considerations**
     - Limiting query depth
     - Authentication and Authorization

5. **Integration with Databases and Other Backends**
   - **Connecting GraphQL to a Database**
     - Using ORMs with GraphQL
     - Example: Connecting GraphQL with MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.
   - **GraphQL with REST APIs**
     - Calling REST endpoints within GraphQL resolvers (API Gateway pattern)
   - **GraphQL with Third-Party Services**
     - Integrating with external APIs (e.g., payment gateways, social media)
